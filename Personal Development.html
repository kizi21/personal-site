		<h4><a name="Strengths" href=""> STRENGTHS</a> </h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Emotional Intelligence</li>
			<p>
				According to Segal,Smith,Robinson and Shubin emotional intelligence is defined as the ability <br>
				to understand,use and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress,communicate <br>
				effectively,empathize with others and overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Personally, for <br>
				me it allows my emotions not to get the best of me as such I consider this my biggest strength.<br>
				This because it allows things not to affect me deeply as well as helps me not to get overwhelmed<br>
				when I find myself in emotional situations.
				
			</p>
			<li> Ability to handle stressful situations</li>
			<p>
				In January my grandmother had an accident in which she had to be admitted to the hospital. I remained<br>
				very calm in this situation and as such could handle calling the ambulance,and preparing everything for <br>
				her to be admitted. The ability to handle stressful situations allows me to not feel overwhelmed or freak out<br>
				if something bad happens.
			</p>
			<li> My open-mindedness</li>
			<p>
				I consider myself to be an open-minded person.  This has become a strength of mine because it allows me to<br>
				think outside of the box and understand other persons thought process. It provides as a good advantage in the<br>
				field of I.T. as it allows me to handle programming questions from different angles as well as figure out errors.
			</p>
		</ul>
		Reflecting on these strengths I do not believe I have really been trying to actively develop myself in these past three years.<br>
		In terms of my emotional intelligence I feel like I've developed the nasty habit of ignoring my emotions instead of truly processing<br>
		them. Yes, I can analayze and know exactly what others and myself are feeling. However,for my feelings I tend to ignore them when I cant<br>
		bother to process what I am feelings.  In terms of my ability to handle stressful situations I believe that is not something I need to<br>
		develop any more.

		The personality test I took was the Big Five on http://similarminds.com/.  This test checks which of the five distinctive<br>
		personality traits I am. From the pictures above I am apart of the RLUAN type and my primary type is  Reserved.  In reading<br>
		about the traits of people under this type I do believe it holds some truth to who I am as a person.However, I do believe<br>
		this test can also be based on how you feel at the time.  Throughout our lives our personality develops. In addition to this,<br>
		our mental health has a lot to do with our personality as well. I feel if you take this test with a bad mental health<br>
		you would get a complelty different result than if you were in a good mental state. In conclusion, I believe this test is<br>
		somewhat valid but in my opinion relys heavily on how your mental state is<br>
